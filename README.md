# DBCNN-Pytorch
An experimental PyTorch implementation of Deep Bilinear Pooling for Blind Image Quality Assessment.

# Purpose
Considering the popularity of PyTorch in academia, we hope this repo can help reseachers in IQA.

# Requirements
PyTorch 0.4+
Python 3.6

# Usage with default setting
python DBCNN.py

Only support experiment on LIVE IQA right now, other datasets will be added soon!
